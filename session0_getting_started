# Atomistic Modeling of Materials

## Getting an account on Aqua
Go to [hpce.iitm.ac.in](https://hpce.iitm.ac.in). Under `HPCE ACCESS` menu, select `create HPCE A/C`. You have to login using your _LDAP credentials_. You can give your faculty advisor name and email id while filling the form. Your request will go to your faculty advisor's workflow and after his/her approval, your account will be created by hcpe team and you will receive login credentials. Typically it will take 1-2 working days.

If you are NOT using institute internet, you need **IITM VPN** to access Aqua. For that you have to send request through faculty advisor to netadmin@iitm.ac.in. Then install [FortiClient VPN](https://www.fortinet.com/support/product-downloads#vpn) software to use VPN. The detailed instructions of setting up VPN are given [here](https://cc.iitm.ac.in/node/30). Typically it will take 1-2 working days to get access.
