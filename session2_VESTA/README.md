## Generating Primitive Cell of Al in VESTA
In this session, you will generate primitive cell of Al and export in POSCAR (.vasp) format with fractional coordinates (relative
to lattice vectors).

Step 1: Click on `File` -> `New`

Step 2: Select `Unit cell` -> `Cubic` -> `No. 225 Fm-3m` and enter a=`4.04`

Step 3: Select `Structure parameters` -> `New` -> Enter `x=0, y=0, z=0`  -> `Symbol` -> `Al` -> `OK` <br>
Now, you should be able to see all the 4 atoms of Al.

Step4: Saving lattice vectors and atomic co-ordinates (relative to lattice vectors) in VASP format for primitive cell <br>
Go to `File` -> `Export Data` -> select `VASP (POSCAR;*.vasp)` format -> `Save` -> `Fractional coordinates` and choose `Convert to primitive cell` in the drop down menu. <br>
You can open this file in any text editors, like notepad.

Step 5: Saving the image in .jpg format. <br>
Go to `File` -> `Export Raster Image` -> select `JPEG file (*.jpg)` -> Select scale x as `1` -> `OK`. <br>
You can use scale of 2 or higher for higher image quality.
